# Pseudo Code 

PROMPT the user for the length of one side of the Hexagon 
PROMPT the user for the units associated with the length of one side of the Hexagon
PROMPT the user for the decimals places to be left after rounding 
ASSIGN the length of one side of the Hexagon to a variable called `sideLength`
ASSIGN the units to a variable called `units`
ASSIGN the number of decimal places to a variable called 'roundTo'
ASSIGN the area of the Hexagon to a variable called `area` using the formula `area = (3 * sqrt(3) * sideLength^2) / 2`
PRINT the area of the Hexagon to the console using the following format:
    "The Hexagon has an area of {area} {units}^2"
