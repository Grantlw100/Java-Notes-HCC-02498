## Java Basics 

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is a high-level programming language that is platform-independent, meaning that it can run on any operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is used to develop a wide variety of applications, from web applications to mobile applications to enterprise applications.

### Running Java Programs

**javac** is the Java compiler that converts Java source code into bytecode. The bytecode is then run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
> USE JAVAC TO COMPILE JAVA PROGRAMS BEFORE RUNNING THEM

**java** is the Java interpreter that runs the bytecode generated by the Java compiler.
> USE JAVA TO RUN JAVA PROGRAMS

**Example:**
```terminal
javac HelloWorld.java
// This will compile the Java program into bytecode

ls
HelloWorld.class HelloWorld.java

java HelloWorld
//This will run the recently compiled Java program
//Running compiled Java programs does not require the .class extension
```

### Hello World 

The first line of code any developer will see when learning a new programming language is the "Hello, World!" program. This program is used to demonstrate the basic syntax of the language. Here is the "Hello, World!" program in Java:

```Java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

While Java programs are used on different platforms they are written using a .java file. The name of the file should be the same as the class name or the primary class in the file.
- The `Hello World` program is run in a file called `HelloWorld.java` and the only class in that file is `HelloWorld`. 
    - Classes can be thought of as a single concept or object that is used to define the structure of an object.
    - the domain of a class is everythong within the classes curly braces `{}`
    - each file has one primary class the file is named after
- Methods are used to define the behavior of a class. The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program.
    - similar to classes, methods also have a domain that is defined by the curly braces `{}`

### Endings a line in Java
While it is incredibly annoying, ensure that lines are ended with a semi-colon or the program will not compile.
**Example:**
```Java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

### Print Statements

Print statements output information to the console. 

In the line ```System.out.println("Hello World!");```
- `System` is a built-in Java class that contains useful tools for programs 
- `out` is short for output 
- `println` is short for print line

There are multiple methods of creating a log to a console. 
- `System.out.println()` print statements to the console on a line by itself
- `System.out.print()` prints the output to the console without a new line
- `System.out.printf()` prints a formatted string to the console

### Comments
There are multiple ways to right comments.

**Short Comments** usually just need the basic double slash syntax that is common to many programming languages. 
Example:
```Java
// This is a short comment
```

**Long Comments** are used to describe the purpose of a class or method. They are written between `/*` and `*/`.
Example:
```Java
/*
This is a long comment
It can span multiple lines
*/
```

**Javadoc Comments** are used to create documentation for a class or method. They are written between `/**` and `*/`. JavaDoc comments are used for creating documentation for classes and methods. They are written in a specific format that can be read by the JavaDoc tool to generate documentation in HTML format.
Example:
```Java
/**
 * This is a Javadoc comment
 * It is used to create documentation for a class or method
 */
```

### Methods in Java

A method  is a set of code that is referred to by name and can be called (invoked) at any point in a program simply by utilizing the method's name. Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

**Every Java program needs a method called MAIN** which is the entry point for that file.java. The main method is the first method that is called when a Java program is run.
