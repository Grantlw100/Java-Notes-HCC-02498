# Frameworks vs Development Languages

## Defined

**Frameworks** are a set of predefined methods, functions, and classes that can be used with a Development Language to simplify the process of creating an application without the need for other technologies like CSS and HTML. 

**Development Languages** is a set of rules and syntax to write code that can be executed by a computer. Development Languages are used to create Frameworks. 

## Differences

Frameworks are built on top of Development Languages. Where a Development Language allows  a developer to integrate a multitude of tools, development packages, other Development Languages, and Frameworks into an application, a Framework allows a developer to use a simplfied verison of a Development Language to build an application with far less code. 

Both Frameworks and Development Languages are used to build applications but a framework has precoded instructions and tools so one statement could be used to create an entire document where lines and lines of the same development Languages code would only define the injection sequence for the same document.

## Complement

Frameworks and Development Languages work together to create remarkably simple applications. A development Language is used to initialize a framework, create variables and accept input for an application where the framework is used to accept the data from that input to create an application.


# Maven vs Spring 

## Defined

**Apache Maven** is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

**The Spring Framework** provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

Maven is a useful tool for adding  a suite of technologies to a project and managing the tools of each technology throughout the build process. Maven is used to instruct the build process to compile, test, and package the project with key operations in mind like naming a project, versioning the project, determining the proper name for a projects build directory, etc. Spring on the other hand can make use of Maven. Spring is a framework, meaning, Spring can be used to create an applications project structure, manage and inject dependencies within the project, and manage the lifecycle of the project. Spring can be used to create a project that can be built with Maven. As an example, JUnit5 is a popular testing framework for Java projects. I can download and use a JUnit5 package using Maven without a spring framework. Alternatively, I can use Spring to manage the JUnit5 package and I can use Spring to create a working User Interface for the project itself. Using Maven I can simplify the build process for the same Spring project and I can continue to use Spring to create the front end of my Java project.
