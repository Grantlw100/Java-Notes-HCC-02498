## Variables in java 

### Declaring variables in Java 

To declare a variable in Java, specify its data type followed by the variable's name:

```Java
//Int represents the integer value type 
int age;

// assign the value 25 to the variable age 
age = 25 
```

### The equal sign as an Operator

- The equal sign can be used one time to assign a value to a variable   
    ```Java
    // assign 25 to the age variable
    int age = 25```
- The equal sign can be used twice to compare the variable to a value  
    ```Java
    // check if the age is 25
    age == 25  
    ```


### Variable Naming Rules 

Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore `_` or dollor sign `$`
- Define a variable using letters, digits, nouns, and be specific
- Dollars signs are common standard in scripting langauges 
- Not reserved words and ARE case sensitive;
