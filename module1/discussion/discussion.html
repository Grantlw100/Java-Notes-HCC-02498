<h1>Java's 30 years of Relevance</h1>
<section>
    
<p>
    Since Java's creation in 1995 30 years ago, it has become one of the worlds most widely used programming languages. Java as a programming language has held a top ten position on the Tiobe Index since 2001("Tiobe Index," 2025).
    Java's position on the Tiobe Index fluctuates based on trends programming trends around the world. Java held Tiobe's number one spot in April of 2020, a lowest position of #4 in Auguest 2024, and was the language of the year in 2005 and 2015. 
    Of the many reasons Java has maintained its top ten spot on the Tiobe Index, one of the largest reasons is mainly due to its simplicity and ease of access. Java is a free, well supported, simplem, platform independent Object Oritented Programming language. 
    In the article "Why developers prefer java programming over other languages?" by Dhruv, S. (2024), the author Stuti runs through a large list of reasons why Java has maintained its relevance over other programming languages. Originally designed on top of the C++ language, Java aimed to simplify the process of writing programs. Even as the language itself grows older and becomes that much more complex, the core principles of simplicity and ease of access remian. 
    As Java progresses, older Java projects are still capable of running without hick ups thanks to Java's backwards compatibility (McKenzie, 2023.) This is a huge advantage for companies that have been using Java for years. Java is designed to function independently without te need for recompiling or reconfiguring. 
    Java programs, upon compilation, are compiled in bytecode; so, any machine that has a JVM installed can run a Java program. 
    Of the many reasons a programming language may be popular, Java takes some of the traits that are abundant in many popular languages and builds ontop of them in a means that keeps the language popular and widely usable. For back-end, front-end, and mobile development Java as a language is more "ature language, therefore more stable and predictable" (Davis, 2022) with a large community, a large suite of technology built with Java as the foundation, and a large number of developers who are familiar with the language, Java is likely to remain a top ten language for years to come.
